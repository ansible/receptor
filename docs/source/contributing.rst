Contributions to Receptor go through the Github pull request process.

An initial checklist for your change to increase the likelihood of acceptance:
- No issues when running linters/code checkers
- No issues from unit/functional tests
- Write good commit messages. See [How to write a Git commit message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/).

===============
Release process
===============

Maintainers have the ability to run the `Stage Release`_ workflow. Running this workflow will:

- Build and push the container image to ghcr.io. This serves as a staging environment where the image can be tested.
- Create a draft release at `<https://github.com/ansible/receptor/releases>`_

After the draft release has been created, edit it and populate the description. Once you are done, click "Publish release".

After the release is published, the `Promote Release <https://github.com/ansible/receptor/actions/workflows/promote.yml>`_ workflow will run automatically. This workflow will:

- Publish receptorctl to `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/receptorctl/>`_.
- Pull the container image from ghcr.io, re-tag, and push to `Quay.io <https://quay.io/repository/ansible/receptor>`_.
- Build binaries for various OSes/platforms, and attach them to the `release <https://github.com/ansible/receptor/releases>`_.

.. note::
  If you need to re-run `Stage Release`_ more than once you must delete the tag beforehand, otherwise the workflow will fail.

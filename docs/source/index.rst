Receptor is an overlay network intended to ease the distribution of work across a large and dispersed collection of workers. Receptor nodes establish peer-to-peer connections with each other via existing networks. Once connected, the receptor mesh provides datagram (UDP-like) and stream (TCP-like) capabilities to applications, as well as robust unit-of-work handling with resiliency against transient network failures.

#
# receptor.conf
#
# This is a YAML-formatted file in which each block represents a Receptor
# configuration directive.  For a list of possible directives, see
# "receptor --help".  Below is a basic example of a single node.


# To create and launch a new systemd-managed Receptor node:
#
# 1. Copy this file to /etc/receptor/<some-name>.conf
# 2. chmod 0600 if the new file will contain any passwords or sensitive data
# 3. Edit the new config file as needed
# 4. systemctl enable receptor@<some-name> --now


# Basic properties of the node.  The node ID must be unique.
- node:
    id: receptor

# The control service allows receptorctl to talk to the running service,
# and is also used for functions like remote work submission.
- control-service:
    service: control
    filename: /var/run/receptor.sock

# A listener allows other Receptor nodes to connect to this one.
- tcp-listener:
    port: 2345

# A work-command defines a type of worker that jobs can be submitted to.
- work-command:
    worktype: hello
    command: /bin/echo
    params: "Hello, world!"
